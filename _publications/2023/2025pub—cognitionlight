  Inspired by human meta-reasoning, this work introduces "CognitionLight", a cognitively inspired control plugin 
  that regulates agent behavior via symbolic “traffic-light” signals (Continue, Switch Persona, Rollback). 
  CognitionLight adaptively guides reasoning strategies in multi-turn scenarios, mitigating hallucinations and 
  enabling adaptive persona-aware reasoning. Experiments on multi-turn reasoning benchmarks show that 
  CognitionLight improves response consistency, reduces hallucinations, and enhances flexibility in dynamic agent behavior.
